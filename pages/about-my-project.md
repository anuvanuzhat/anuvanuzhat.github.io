subtitle: AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes
project_title: "AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Thyroid, Celiac, and Cardiovascular Disorders"
problem: |
  Indivituals with Type 1 Diabetes are often at risk of other health problems associated with diabetes. Complications can arise over time because of high blood pressure which can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to complications. Managing diabetes is a lot to handle at once and involves tracking multiple things at once such as insulin intake, tracking blood sugar levels and more.

  This project seeks to create personalized treatment plans for people with Type 1 diabetes using a specific type of AI called Deep Q Networks. The model will learn from personalized healthcare data like heart activity and blood sugar levels and suggest tailored strategies for the patient. This way patients can better manage their diabetes while simultaneously reduce their risk of other health complications. 

approach: |
  Over the course of the summer the approach for the project inludes...
    1. Training a Deep Q Network to adapt to treatment based on T1D patients
    2. Clean and prepare a set of data for AI training use
    3. Create different simulations for the model to test different treatment strategies and their health impact
    4. Evalue the model and compare the reccomendations to real world 

outcome: |
  The outcomes of this project include a trained AI driven system capable of recommending optimized treatment strategies to manage
comorbidity risk in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients. By using Deep Q-Networks (DQN), the system will learn from individual patient data and
continuously adapt to provide the most effective treatment plans. We also expect to have an evaluation report in showing how well the AI performs in reducing health risks and improving treatment effectiveness.
