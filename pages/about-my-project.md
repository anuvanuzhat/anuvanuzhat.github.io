subtitle: AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes
project_title: "AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Thyroid, Celiac, and Cardiovascular Disorders"
problem: |
  Individuals living with Type 1 Diabetes often face more than just the challenge of managing their blood glucose levels. Over time, they are at increased risk of developing a range of comorbid conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disorders, and celiac disease. Among these, high blood pressure is particularly concerning, as it can progressively damage the heart, arteries, kidneys, and other vital organs. The presence of multiple chronic conditions compounds the complexity of care and heightens the risk of serious, long-term complications.
  
  Managing Type 1 Diabetes effectively requires continuous vigilance and effort. Patients must regularly monitor their blood sugar, administer the correct doses of insulin, manage dietary intake, and remain physically active—all while responding to fluctuations caused by stress, illness, or hormonal changes. The addition of comorbidities like hypertension further increases this burden, as it requires additional medications, lifestyle adjustments, and health monitoring.
  
  This constant need to juggle various aspects of care can lead to treatment fatigue and decreased adherence, ultimately affecting health outcomes. As such, there is a critical need for intelligent, personalized support systems that can help patients manage their condition holistically, reduce complications, and improve their quality of life.

  This project seeks to create personalized treatment plans for people with Type 1 diabetes using a specific type of AI called Deep Q Networks. The model will learn from personalized healthcare data like heart activity and blood sugar levels and suggest tailored strategies for the patient. This way patients can better manage their diabetes while simultaneously reducing their risk of hypertension. 

approach: |
  Over the course of the summer the approach for the project inludes…
  1. Training a Deep Q Network to adapt to treatment based on T1D patients
  2. Clean and prepare a set of data for AI training use
  3. Create different simulations for the model to test different treatment strategies and their health impact
  4. Evaluate the model and compare the recommendations to real world

outcome: |
  The outcomes of this project include a trained AI driven system capable of recommending optimized treatment strategies to manage
  comorbidity risk in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients. By using Deep Q-Networks (DQN), the system will learn from individual patient data and
  continuously adapt to provide the most effective treatment plans. We also expect to have an evaluation report in showing how well the AI     performs in reducing health risks and improving treatment effectiveness.
