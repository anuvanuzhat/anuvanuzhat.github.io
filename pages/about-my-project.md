subtitle: AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes
project_title: "AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Thyroid, Celiac, and Cardiovascular Disorders"
problem: |
  Indivituals with Type 1 Diabetes are often at risk of other health problems associated with diabetes. However, there aren't many ways to determine the risks of contacting other health problems while looking at current Type 1 Diabetes patients.

  This project seeks to explore how using AI reinforcement learning we can look at patient data and find preemptive signs of other health problems specifically thyroid, celiac and cardiovascular disorders that can come with Type 1 diabetes.
