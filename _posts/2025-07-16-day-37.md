what_i_learned: >  
  Today we implemented the code needed to look into our performance metrics. We decided to find time in range, above range, and below range 
  for glucose and blood pressure as well as find the cumulative rewards and convgergence speeds. Our first experiment will just be looking 
  at comparing all the models with biochemical parameters without taking into account the sex and age demographics. At first all the performance
  metrics were looking great until it came time to make comparisons with my teammate. Then the problems arose of our model differences. To compare
  the different DQN models we needed to use the same hyperparameters but even more hard to fix the same reward functions.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  My teammate uses a more simple approach with smaller numbers while mine uses a bigger more complex approach. Each one has its strengths
  and weaknesses and one of us will have to change our model to reflect these changes so the issue is a little complex. Dr. Dacon is 
  looking to find a solution so we're waiting back on him to hear where to go from here. We started working on our LaTeX table with all of 
  our results for our first experiment as well so we learned a bit when it came to that.
