what_i_learned: >  
  Today Dr. Dacon and our team had a meeting to discuss our results and the specifics we wanted to highlight for our presentation.
  We decieded to shift our performance metrics from time in range, time above range, and time below range to mean success rate, and mean
  unsafe rate. This was because we thought our testing data was too small to be scored based on the previous metrics as the numbers were 
  either really high or really low. We also decided to present our project 1 for the final presentation and then submit our second project
  to a later conference instead of AAAI.

  No Blockers.

reflection: >  
  We finished a majority of our presentation except some components. Dr. Dacon is still brainstorming some ideas for how our demo video should
  look so I will probably work on filming that tomorrow. I was thinking about running through our BIO-DQN and explaining parts of the code but
  I will wait and see what Dr. Dacon comes up with. 
  We also need to finish some methodology slides and our results slides. 
  I feel really good and less worried about the final presentation as things are finally coming together well.
