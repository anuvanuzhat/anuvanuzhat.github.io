what_i_learned: |
  Today we began the day with our Python workshop and did a couple labs on writing file reports with different sets of data. 
  Later we had a presentation on generative AI and got to play around with different softwares creating our own AI songs and characters. We also delved deeper into neural networks and LLMS. We also played some games guessing whether imaged were AI generated or not.
  
blockers: |
  I had some trouble on the second lab. But, my fellow cohorts helped me and I was able to get my code working.

reflection: |
  I found it interesting how a lot of things in computer science actually revolve around real world things specifically humans. The concept of neural networks being designed after how the human brain works is really interesting. It shows that humans and computers are more connected than what I originally thought.
