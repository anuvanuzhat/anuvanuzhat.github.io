what_i_learned: |
  Today I watched an MIT lecture on reinforcement learning to further solidify my knowledge. Although through previous research I knew the 
  basics of RL, I learned deeper into policy learning and value learning today. The video talked about some downsides of Q learning and how
  the model is only capable of a small and discrete action space, however in a policy gradient we can solve this challenge by looking
  at a sample of action results and making a probability distribution. I later read and took notes on more literature on T1D and looked at a 
  larger data set from Granada Spain.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
   The idea of policy learning is just incredible because it's how we're able to create things like self-driving cars. Even though 
   hypothetically on paper it seems great to run a policy until termination, in a real world setting like self driving cars,
   the implications of that, policy ending when the car crashes, aren't so great. This brought the speaker into a really cool discussion
   about how this problem can be solved. Using hyporealistic simulations these cars can learn without having to get into a real car crash.
