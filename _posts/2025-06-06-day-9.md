what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on our RL game play and trying to get our agent to learn from its environment and make it to the end point. 
  I tried various different episodes for training as well as training the agent with the slippery settings on and off. I also made it so my code
  would output a graph showing the episode number vs the reward. After training my agent with 30,000 different episodes I was able to get 100%
  success, and my agent succeeded! I learned how to train a basic RL agent as well as create graphs to help visualize its progress. After a week of
  trying I'm super excited it finally worked!

reflection: |
  I learned a lot from my RL mini game working. I coded my FrozenLake program so that there was a training setting that I could set to boolean 
  True or False. When I had the training setting turned to false my agent achieved very little reward and didn't learn all that much. After turning
  the training setting to true I noticed a drastic increase in the rewards and the more episodes I did the more my agent did well. 
  I honestly had so much fun working with this game and training the AI. It was really cool to see an applicable version of an RL model and learn
  some basics into what our project will be working on.
