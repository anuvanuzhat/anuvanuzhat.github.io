  Today we began a workshop at the business building looking into specific member strengths and personality types to see how we could cater
  them to work for our project. It was honestly very unique and I haven't ever really thought about using different learning types and personality
  types to optimize the strengths of our teams and get rid of the weaknesses. Aftwerwards the team kept working on our project. My model is now 
  doing well enough that I can implement some better performance metrics other than the accuracy which wouldn't be strong in a research paper. 
  So far today I've implemented a TIR (time in range) metric that see's how long my model stays within the glucose ranges of 80-130 vs 70-140.
  I got around 70% and 80% respectively which means it's doing really well.

  I feel really happy about the improvement of my model especially considering all the low energy I was feeling last week on top of a low accuracy
  DQN model. I was brain storming some other metrics to look at and I want to look into time above range and time below range as well. Some other
  metrics could be cumulative reward and convergence speed as well. Dr. Dacon also began showing us the paper he started and what parts we would be
  working on. This will be my first time writing a technical paper so I'm very exicited!
