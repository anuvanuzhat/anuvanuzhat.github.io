  I spent today continuing to train the model with all the biochemical parameters which are creatinine, ALT, sodium, and potassium. 
  This gave me a clearer sense of how the model is currently behaving when tasked with learning from a more complex and multidimensional 
  reward signal. Even though I worked on trying out different ways to calculate reward and messing around with different step functions,
  my model was just not doing well with having to worry about 7 different parameters. I also had a valuable discussion with Dr. Dacon about 
  how we’ll define and evaluate our end model, and how to ensure the   technical soundness of the final deliverable. We also touched on 
  combining our various research questions in a coherent way.

  Although I worked on improving model accuracy throughout the day, I didn’t observe much improvement in performance. This has been a bit 
  frustrating but also reminds me that tuning a complex model, especially one dealing with multiple interrelated physiological variables, 
  takes time and iteration. Talking through next steps with Dr. Dacon was helpful for re-grounding the project in its larger goals: what 
  the final model should accomplish, how it will be used, and how we can tie together the research directions in a technically rigorous way.
  Going forward, I want to focus not just on performance metrics, but also on how well the model aligns with clinical relevance and 
  real-world use cases.
