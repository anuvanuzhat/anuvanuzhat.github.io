what_i_learned: >  
  Today we began implementing all the discrepancies between each others model into our own. My teammate needed to add the biochemical parameters
  to effect his rewards while I needed to make my reward function match his. I also have more hyper parameters than him which he will need to add
  as well as incorporating blood pressure. I must incorporate sex and age using his way to effect the rewards now as well. 
  The measurements we took yesterday are now nulled due to all the discrepencies.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  I'm feeling a little overwhemled and stressed because of having to restart a lot of our work but I hope by tomorrow we will be able to fix 
  our models and start collecting data. Once we have the Dueling and Double DQN's measurements I'm sure the other ones will be easier to 
  implement and include in the experiment. If everything goes smoothly I think we will still be on track. Our paper is coming along nicely
  as well.
