what_i_learned: >  
  Today, I incorporated additional biochemical parameters creatinine, potassium, sodium, and ALT into my reward and step functions. 
  This allowed the environment to simulate more realistic physiological dynamics beyond just glucose and blood pressure. I learned how to 
  model random variations and penalties for extreme values, as well as how to balance multiple weighted objectives in a reward function. 
  By refining the reward shaping logic, I improved how the agent evaluates trade-offs between targeting critical and secondary parameters.

  Expanding the environment to include more biochemical factors helped me appreciate the complexity of multi-objective decision-making in 
  real-world health scenarios. It was rewarding to design a reward system that promotes stability across several physiological variables 
  without letting one dominate the others. This change will allow my agent to develop more nuanced policies that reflect real patient 
  trade-offs. So far this model isn't doing great with only a 0.6% accuracy rate (6 out of 1000 episodes in acceptable ranges). 
  I'm excited to see how much improvement I can make and test how these updates affect training outcomes and convergence over longer           episodes.
