what_i_learned: |
  Today I looked into some research papers involving different AI learning algorithms utilized in healthcare. I found an article about 
  scalable deep learning with electronic health records. The study had multiple prediciton tasks which incuded inpatient mortality, patient
  readmission risk, length of stay, and diagnosis prediction. I learned about the three different architectures used to look into the 4 tasks
  and time points used in the research. I thought many ideas could help improve our own research including utilizing multiple different learning 
  models and then ensembling them all at the end for a stronger prediciton.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
   One of the key insights I gained from this research was the importance of using diverse learning models to capture the EHR data.
   Rather than relying on a single predictive model, the researchers implemented several different architectures which each offered 
   their own strengths in processing sequential clinical dataâ€”and then explored ensemble methods to improve overall
   prediction accuracy. Our RL model could use different neural network learning methods like DQN's, DDQN's or categorical DQN's.
