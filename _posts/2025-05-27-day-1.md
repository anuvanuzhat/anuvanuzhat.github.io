  Today I met the other undergraduate students and fellow group members for my research project. We did some fun activities to get to know each other and prep for next week in person. We also had a quick refresh on Github and Git.

  I was very excited to learn about everyone apart of the program and delve deeper into what this summer will entail for me. Starting on the website itself was super exciting as well!
