what_i_learned: >  
  Unfortunately after getting feedback from Dr. Dacon I need to re-visit the Dueling DQN as the model does better than our transformer hybrid.
  This may be due to improvements needed to be made in the transformer hybrid model as well as the Dueling DQN having suspiciously high values 
  for time in range of blood pressure and time above range for glucose. I decided to implement a simpler but straightforward custom environment
  and replace my more complicated one. We also filmed out 90 second elevator pitch for our project today so our team brainstormed a fun idea, wher
  I got to be the director and editor as well as play a minor character in our sketch. It was pretty fun to have a creative outlet regarding
  this project beyond a technical paper and presentation..

  Getting our transformer hybrid model to perform the best. 

reflection: >  
  Tomorrow Dr. Dacon will be coming in so I think it will be good to get some feedback and direction by meeting with him. I think I can probably
  finish my Dueling DQN for good tomorrow and make good progress on my Rainbow soon. I also had a fun time directing our sketch today. I realize
  that I like taking more responsibility and control when it comes to group things so it was fun leading the project. Also I had a fun time editing
  our video and adding humourous parts to it that I think my teammates liked.
