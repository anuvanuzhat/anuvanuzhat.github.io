what_i_learned: >  
  I finally got some data for experiment one as my Dueling DQN was working with age and sex included in. Using age and sex to vary insulin
  resistence in each patient we get a variety of ways each patient will react to different insulin and blood pressure medication dosages. 
  I also had to change the reward function and I thought that with these smaller rewards and penalities the model would do worse because
  I was less so "whipping" it into shape like before and now giving it gentle nudges. However to my suprise the model actually improved in
  it's accuracy which is abnormal. 

blockers: >  
  No Blockers.

  Now that the Dueling DQN is working I can focus on the other one which is Rainbow. Now this one has been giving my teammate
  and graduate mentor a lot of trouble but I think since I have one model doing well I can easily make adjustments to the others. Hopefully
  experiment 1 will be done soon and then we can move onto the next experiments. My graduate mentor just needs to implement the transformer 
  to one of our DQN's and then test those results.
