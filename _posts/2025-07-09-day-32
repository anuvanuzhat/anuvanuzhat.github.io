  Today, Dr. Dacon advised us to split our research into two separate projects to better focus our questions and goals. We talked about our
  next steps with the two new projects and now having to work on two research papers. I was able to improve
  my modelâ€™s accuracy significantly, raising it from just over 1% to around 30% for glucose predictions. This progress feels encouraging and
  motivates me to continue refining the model. I also gained a clearer understanding of how to manage complex datasets with multiple 
  biochemical parameters.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  Splitting the project into two parts was a valuable suggestion that helped me think more critically about research focus and achievable 
  goals. My other biochemical parameters are finally going great except for glucose which is at 30% accuracy rate. 
  I feel more a little more stressed now we have two projects and our scope has shifted. I think the last two weeks might be a little stressful
  but Dr. Dacon isn't worried so I hope that it all works out!
