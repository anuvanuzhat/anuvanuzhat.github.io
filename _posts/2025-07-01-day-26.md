what_i_learned: >  
  Today, I focused on preparing my slides for the upcoming Mid-Program Symposium. I delved down into weeks of technical work into 
  a digestible material so that those who aren't familiar with my project can understand. I highlighted my project's goals, methods, 
  and early results. Reviewing related literature helped me better contextualize my approach and identify how my work builds on existing studies in reinforcement learning for healthcare.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  Working on the presentation gave me a chance to reflect on the progress I’ve made so far—from understanding the medical complexities of 
  comorbidities in Type 1 Diabetes to implementing and refining a Dueling DQN agent. It also pushed me to think critically about the 
  challenges I've faced, like balancing all the biochemical parameters and model stability, and how I’ve grown through those moments. 
  I’m proud of how much I’ve learned and excited (and a little nervous) to present it all soon.
