what_i_learned: |
  Today I wanted to help out my labmate since she was struggling with implementing the Rainbow DQN. Although I got far in it, I realized later on in the day that my Dueling DQN faltered in it's rewards and wasn't
learning as optimally as I had hoped. I then tried different numbers again with it's epsilon decay, learning rates, and episode numbers but for some
reason no matter how many times I change the number the program just never finishes running. I'm not sure what the problem is but it's quite frustrating
to see I had to go back on my progress today. 

blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  I learned a very important lesson research today that sometimes you can go back in progress you've made and have to start a process over. Not everything
can work out perfectly in your favor so it's important to experience failure to make sure your research is stronger and more reliable. It still is frustrating that
it seemed to be working last week and now all of a sudden it isn't working as I had hoped. I think this may be a google colab issue and not completely a coding issue
as google colab runs extremely slow, so I may try running some of this on VS Code.
