  Today I began implementing some other prevelant biochemical parameters (creatinine, sodium, potassium, alanine transaminase) into my model. 
  Adding this many parameters makes things a lot more complicated and gives me way more to think about. I had to go back to my research question
  to stay grounded but I guess I still have a couple questions with how I want these other parameters to affect my patients. It gives
  me more to think about like whether it should affect the models rewards or just be apart of the state.

  Today was just very code heavy with implementing the new model. At the end of today I decided to incorporate the biochemical parameters more 
  dynamically and include them when it comes time for the model to give rewards based off of their ranges. When things get complicated like this
  it's hard to stay focused and on task so I originally wanted to include generated insulin levels in the bloodstream however after looking back 
  at the design doc and grounding myself I wanted to stay within the scope of my question and focus on the already challenging task of multiple parameters.
