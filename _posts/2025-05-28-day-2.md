what_i_learned: |
  Today I meet my graduate student mentor as well as my faculty mentor. We talked through some preliminary materials to get familiar with our research topic of RL learning and Type 1 Diabetes. I learned about the risk of comorbidity for Type 1 Diabetes and the real world data we would be looking at for the research. 
  
  The program ended with some python review on sets and dictionaries. We finished the day with a fun game. 

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice to meet the mentors who would be guiding me along the research project. I also found the preliminary materials quite fun! I read more on what comordability means and how RL is used in real world medical applications. I'm excited to start brainstorming ideas for the research proposal.
