what_i_learned: |
  Today I meet my graduate student mentor as well as my faculty mentor. We talked through some preliminary materials to get familiar with our research topic of RL learning and Type 1 Diabetes. Then the program began some python review with sets and dictionaries. We ended the day with a fun game. 

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  It was nice to meet the mentors who would be guiding me along the research project. I also found the preliminary materials quite fun!
