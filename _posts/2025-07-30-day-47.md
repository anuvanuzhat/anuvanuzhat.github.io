  Today is the last day before our big final presentation tomorrow. We finished up our slides and distributed who would present what.
  So I'm going to be focusing on our results, methodology, and the project overview. Basically this entails talking through what 
  we did in our experiments and the outcomes of them, the two models we ended up proposing in our research and a brief general summary of 
  the entire project.

  It’s a bit surreal that we’ve reached the last day of the program. Looking back, the amount of work we’ve done and how much I’ve learned feels really rewarding.
  Prepping for the final presentation made me realize how far we’ve come from our initial ideas to a fully-formed research project.
  I’m a little nervous about presenting, but I’m also excited to share our work and see what everyone else has done.
  No matter how tomorrow goes, I’m proud of the effort we’ve put in and everything I’ve gained from this experience.
