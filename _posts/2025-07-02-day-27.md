  Today, I finished preparing my slides presentation for the Mid Symposium presentation tomorrow. I worked on finishing some literature review
  I wanted to talk about as well as some personal goals. I also filmed the demo video for our team where I showcased my current working Dueling
  DQN model and talked through some of the main aspects of RL and DQN's that were in the code. I had to refilm the video a couple of times but I 
  think the final one will be helpful for everyone to understand RL and DQN's a little bit better. We then ended the day by practicing presenting
  and going over some presentation improvements we could make.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  I learned a lot about how to better my presentation skills and how to improve on them. I'm not too bad on confidence mentally but my body 
  language is still more on the shy side rather than being more open. I also had a lot of fun recording the demo video as I felt like it strengthened
  my explanation and understanding of my own code. It's always good to be able to explain how each of your components come together.
