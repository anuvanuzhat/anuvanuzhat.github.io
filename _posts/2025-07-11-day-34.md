what_i_learned: >  
  Today I rewrote my DQN model for biochemical parameters and significantly improved its accuracy from 30% to 55%.  
I learned how tuning the reward function and exploration strategy can greatly affect performance in reinforcement learning.  
Meeting with Dr. Dacon helped clarify the new project direction and how to align our goals with demographic-specific analysis.  
Collaborating with Holy has been helpful in narrowing our focus to hypertension and biochemical changes across age and sex groups. We also
filmed our weekly presentation update video.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
   It was really exciting to see a big jump in accuracy after working hard to refine the model.  
The project pivot feels meaningful because it's more targeted and will likely lead to more insightful results.  
It’s interesting to see how the team is now split across different comorbidities and demographic explorations, which makes our research broader.  
Filming the weekly update was a good chance to reflect on everything we’ve accomplished and where we’re headed next. Dr. Dacon promised us
lunch on him if we make a lot of progress this week so I'm super excited.
