what_i_learned: |
  Today we began the day by discussing our research findings on Hypertension. I worked on my FrozenLake RL model and tried winning my mini-game. 
  My little character unfortunately keeps falling in the hole but through the actual coding process I learned a lot about RL rewards and states. 
  Through the mini-game I feel like I have a better idea of what training our RL agent will look like and got a visual idea of RL concepts. 
  We also worked on cleaning up some data by using pandas and numpy to make graphs and charts to look at the specifics of our data.

blockers: |
  The FrozenLake mini-game is extremely hard and no matter how many episodes I run my program my agent keeps failing. I might try to do a CartPole simulation tomorrow instead.

reflection: |
  Working on my RL mini-game was a lot of fun even though I didn't succeed. I thought I understood the RL concepts well but 
  actually seeing it be applied in my mini-game really strengthened the information in my head. I'm starting to think about these concepts being applied to our project and how
  the states and environment would differ between the two. I also am starting to think about the data more. Even though the data seems simple, there is
  actually quite a lot to think about and the implications of them.
