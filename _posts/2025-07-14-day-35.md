  Today I kept working on my DQN model with the biochemical parameters and my accuracy improved greatly to around 80%. This is high enough
  for us to keep moving forward on our research so the next step is going to be including the demographics of age and sex into the model.
  Although my glucose and bp success rates are relatively high the other biochemical parameters bring the accuracy down to 80% ish which is 
  actually good because it's a sign the model is not overfitted to the data. I am curious to see however if the specific accuracy rates would
  be considered "too high" since they are in the high 90's and 100.

  I am really struggling with this project pivot. Although I got the new model to work it still feels daunting about all the things still left to do.
  I'm not sure at all how to incorporate the demographics of age and sex into the model. I don't know if they should affect any of the biochemical
  parameter levels or be included in the environment or just the state. I think my whole team needs some guidance on what to do next and Dr. Dacon
  is coming in tomorrow so hopefully we can be more assured in the following days.
