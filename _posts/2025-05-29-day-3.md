what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with a workshop learning about Computer Vision. During this workshop we learned how to train our computer models to classify different images. Firstly we got introduced to computer vision with previously trained models on Teachable Machine. We then trained them ourselves using YOLO V8 and tried it out on some images and videos.
  
  We then did a escape room with our group mates to work on teamwork and collaboration. After we did some python practice with brain teasers on sets and dictionaries and also learned about file I/O.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Training the AI using YOLO V8 was definitely my favorite part. It was so cool to see how it could identify different people and parts of a video. I'm really interested in learning more about computer vision and how I can apply it to my research. The escape room was also a lot of fun and had gotten me closer to my group mates.
