what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with a workshop learning about Computer Vision. During this workshop we learned how to train our computer models to classify different images. Firstly we got introduced to computer vision with previously trained models on Teachable Machine. We then trained them ourselves using YOLO V8 and tried it out on some images and videos.

  Training the AI using YOLO V8 was definitely my favorite part. It was so cool to see how it could identify different people and parts of a video.
