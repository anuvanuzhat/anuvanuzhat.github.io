what_i_learned: |
  Today we began working on making our DQN models. We want to look at a basic DQN model and compare it with a Noisy DQN to see
  how it compares. It took me the entire day to finish the basic DQN and tomorrow I hope to train it and look at some graphs for my results.
  Since I have had zero experience with DQN models this was my first time being introduced to how they worked. I began by making edits
  to me T1DHypertension environment which so far does not utilize the actual data set but only randomly
  generated physiological parameters. Then I began working on my agent and my training loops. I learned how to
calculate Q values using DQN formula and got down the basics of PyTorch with my model. I then defined my hyperparameters and 
experience loops and then finally my DQN. I still need to play around with my optimize function to see the best ways for my model to learn.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Honestly today I learned so much information my brain hurts but it's days like these that are so important for learning! Over the week
I hope to solidify all that I learned. I'm honestly really proud of all my code and I'm super excited to train it and improve it. Today I
only finished implementing my DQN and haven't begun the Noisy DQN yet so I'm a little intimadated but still excited to begin that as well. I
was thinking about maybe implementing a Dueling DQN as well and comparing to see which one fared the best. After weeks of preparation and research I'm so excited
we finally got to begin our implementation!
