what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in person meeting. We got introduced to everyone and had some discussions about AI and ethics in the auditorium. Next we did a team exercise where we tried building the tallest noodle structure. Our team did not win but we were so close. Later we did some prework. I'm in the process of learning how to use FrozenLake and making an RL agent to solve a mini game. I also successfully was able to run some TD1 data on my Google Colab to look at some graphs and charts on trends with the patients. 

blockers: |
  I'm still having trouble getting my RL agent and mini game to work. My code is running through some errors and the preliminary resources weren't working so I had to do some research on my own. The data that we were looking at was also hard to understand at first.

reflection: |
  I found the AI discussion in the beginning to be pretty interesting. It's sort of scary to see how AI can alter reality as we know it in our digital era. I also was very excited to get started on our project for the summer. I liked the way Dr. Dacon visualized and mapped out the "problem" and how we had to blend computation and biological aspects.
