what_i_learned: >  
  Today, we officially began planning our final presentation as a team.  
  We discussed the key results we want to highlight, especially those tied to our most recent experiments.  
  I learned how important it is to clearly communicate the progression of our project and justify our design decisions.  
  We also started drafting a basic slide outline to structure our narrative around challenges, methods, and results.

reflection: >  
  Starting the final presentation felt a bit overwhelming since we’re still wrapping up some of our experiments.  
  It’s been difficult to decide which findings to include because a few metrics are still in progress.  
  We had to balance presentation prep with continued experimentation, which made everything feel rushed.  
  Still, collaborating with my teammates on the big picture helped clarify what we’ve achieved so far and what’s left to polish.
