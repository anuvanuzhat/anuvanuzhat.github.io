what_i_learned: |
  Today we finished writing our design document filling our different sections for our research questions, methods, and approach styles. We then discussed the document with Dr. Dacon and got some initial feedback to help us prepare for our second version and make improvements. Dr. Dacon had another student coming in today for a different research project so we got to meet her and learn about her research involving NPL models. She'll be here for the week so that super exciting to get to know what she's working on!

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
   The feedback we got on our document was extremely helpful. Dr. Dacon helped us refine and add specificity to our research questions to 
   get a closer scope on our research. He said I was a strong writer for the average person but I needed some more practice writing 
   technically and for scientific papers. One improvement I needed to work on was further developing my ideas and tailoring them to our
   specific RL approach.
