  Today we had a guest speaker come in and do a workshop with us. Dr. Crawford from the University of Alabama
  came in and gave us a presentation on brain computer interfaces and human robot interaction. He talked to us about some of his older 
  projects such as tongue protrusion detection by using it's color and texure characteristics. We also got to try out some of his newer projects
  today like using electric signals from our brain to control a drone and electric signals from our body to move a robot. This activity
  was honestly super fun and reminded me why I love tech so much as I was feeling a little discouraged recently with these obstacles 
  we're facing in our research.

  No Blockers.

  What was so cool about the projects we got to test out what we could make it (the drone or robot) custom to our specific movements. For example
  our group added code so our drone would go up if we blinked and go forward if we clenched our jaw. I feel really inspired to by a small 
  computer like they had for their robot so I can play around with robotics at home and make my own tiny robot as well. I've been wanting
  to get into raspberry pi's and I feel like this was the push to do it. Overall I really loved this workshop.
