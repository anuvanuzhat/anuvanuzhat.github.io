what_i_learned: |
  Today we looked at the T1D data sets and began cleaning some of the data to decide which comorbidity to choose for our research. Even though
  I had previous experience with Python Pandas before, it was my first time in awhile using it again. I also learned a lot about T1D itself 
  as we did a lot of research on it and the types of comorbidities most commonly associated with it.
  

blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a little bit boring since it mostly consisted of looking over data, cleaning it, and researching about T1D. Still, I had fun for the little 
  bits of coding I did do today where I got to use Pandas.
