what_i_learned: |
  Today we took a tour around campus and saw various different buildings. Morgan State's campus is quite nice but I missed certain aspects of my campus back home. 
  We also continued working on yesterdays data cleaning and making graphs out of the data we found using Pandas and Numpy. I made a heat map to show the correlation between 
  the different biochemical parameters in patients with Hypertension, as well as a histogram showing the top 5 biochemical parameters in patients with Hypertension
  and those without. My lab mates did some other graphs so we finished with organizing and cleaning the data.

  Making the heat map was a nice challenge. It took me a really long time to understand how to pivot my data table to work with a heat map.

reflection: |
  Today I feel like I did a lot of coding and so I learned a lot about making graphs. The graphs are super helpful into
  looking for what trends and patterns matter the most. It was my first time really being introduced to how heatmaps work, and also my first time
  coding one. Even though it was a challenge I'm really proud of how mine turned out and the effort I put into it. It was really cool to see all 
  the correlations between the different biochemical parameters.
