  Today we began the day with our SAIRI Cohort Connect which included some fun games and a workshop. During the workshop I got an introduction to Overleaf as a way to prepare for writing our final project papers. We then looked over the RL framework again and I jotted down some notes on what the Q values were showing and what our model had learnt. Although it's a really good start, I noticed some things needed improvementâ€”like adding further reward for good behavior and ending the program if the agent gets to dangerous levels of glucose or blood pressure to signify death.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  The Overleaf session gave me a helpful introduction that I think will be particularly useful for our collaborative paper, and I'm excited to apply it moving forward. During our continued exploration of the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, I revisited the Q-values generated by our agent and spent some time interpreting what the model has learned so far. I was able to make sense of how the agent is currently navigating treatment decisions based on glucose and blood pressure states. I also started to think critically about how we might improve our setup, and I hope to implement those changes and observe how the Q-values evolve.
