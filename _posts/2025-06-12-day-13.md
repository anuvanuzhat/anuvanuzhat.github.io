what_i_learned: |
   Today we began the day with our SAIRI Cohort Connect which included some fun games and a workshop. During the workshop I got a 
introduction to Overleaf as a way to prepare for writing our final project papers. We then looked over the RL framework again and I jotted
down some notes on what the Q values were showing and what our model had learnt. Although it's a really good start I noticed some things
needed for improvement like adding further reward for good behavior and ending the program if the agent gets to dangerous levels of 
glucose or blood pressure medication to signify death.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
    The Overleaf session gave me a helpful introduction that I think will be particularly helpful for our collaborative paper and I'm
excited to apply it moving forward. During our continued exploration of the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, I revisited the Q-values
generated by our agent and spent some time interpreting what the model has learned so far. I was able to make sense of how the agent is 
currently navigating treatment decisions based on glucose and blood pressure states. I tried also looking further to see how it could
be improved to which I hope to implement and see how the Q values change.
