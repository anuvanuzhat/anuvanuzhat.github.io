what_i_learned: |
  Today we began the day by creating our end of week progress slides and filming our video for the program submission. I reflected on the tasks I've accomplished this week and the challenges I faced. We 
  then turned to out RL framework and began conceptualizing how our model could be adjusted to handle our specific patient data. Later we began brainstorming
  some strong research questions and refined 4 of them to include in our design document. Although strong, our research questions can still be
  refined further.

  A challenge I faced today was coming up with a strong and specific research question. A lot of the times some details get skipped so it's
  really important that each question encompasses everything with specificity.

reflection: |
  I think this design document will really help us kickstart beginning our own research and moving past looking at what is already out there.
  Sort of the like our weekly progress video meant to help us regroup and plan for next week, the design document is helpful and important
  for planning the next steps of our project and focusing on how to begin our research. Because research can encompass a lot it will help us
  scope out a more specific aspect to focus on.
