  Today I attended a research writing workshop that focused on communicating scientific work more clearly and confidently. The presenter was
  incredibly passionate and engaging, which made the session enjoyable and informative. We learned about the Morgan State University Writing 
  Center and the valuable support it offers to student researchers. The workshop also emphasized how important it is to reflect on the “why” 
  behind our research when crafting abstracts and project descriptions.

  No Blockers.  

reflection: >  
  It was inspiring to see someone speak about writing with so much enthusiasm. It reminded me that writing is a powerful tool in science. 
  The writing exercises helped me articulate my own research ideas more clearly, which I sometimes struggle with. I left the session feeling
  more confident about how to communicate the purpose and significance of my project.
