  Today I went back over my Dueling DQN model and fixed the reward function, environment, random seed, splitting up my patients
  80 20 for training vs testing and basically a bunch of other things. 
  However it all paid off because I'm finally getting results that are what we are looking for. Before my blood pressure was way too low
  for it to be okay to use the Dueling DQN as a model to compare our hybrid too and my blood glucose level was way too high. The blood glucose
  level being way too high was a problem because it probably meant that my data was overfitting and also it would be hard to get our hybrid model
  to get an accuracy above that.

  I think the biggest thing that made the most difference today was splitting up my patients for training vs testing. I have been running
  into an overfitting data issue where my model has gotten too used to the T1D Granada specific data. Because of this it didn't actually learn properly
  it only learned the data correctly. However, instead of randomly picking a patient where I would run into the problem of re-choosing the same
  patient and instead splitting it up into training vs testing patients, my accuracy numbers looked much more plausible.
