what_i_learned: >  
  Today I realized that the model I had been working with was actually a Double Dueling DQN, not just a Dueling DQN.  
  We had a meeting with Dr. Dacon where we reviewed the baseline models and identified some inconsistencies in how the environment was behaving before as it 
  actually wasn't doing much.  
  It became clear that the environment wasn’t differentiating between agents effectively, which likely explained the similar performance across all models.  
  I also learned that simply switching environments doesn’t always yield new insights unless the underlying structure or reward mechanism is meaningfully different.

  No Blockers.

  The meeting helped highlight how critical it is to verify that the environment is functioning correctly before drawing conclusions from model results.  
  Trying a new environment didn’t change my results, which made me realize I need to dig deeper into how the environment processes actions and states.  
  Moving forward, I plan to debug the environment more systematically and ensure it’s responsive enough to reflect the learning differences between agents.
  Hopefully by tomorrow I can figure out why the results are exactly the same and fix this issue.
